### Have you ever asked yourself how is it possible to learn a lot things and remenber what we have learned? Well, our brain is awesome and able to storage a lot of information. In some cases, if we have a tool to support us when we are learning is better than to trust only in our brain. The Personal Dictionary is a tool to support us to remember when we are learning a new language, when we read a book with a lot of different words and synonyms, small words. A system can help you to keep new words in your mind.
